            MALEO_TYPEWORKS. PROJECT is run by alyp. It started as a curiousity, and a whole lot of YouTube tutorials. I have no prior experience before building my first keyboard but I keep trying my best. My current keyboard (the one that i'm showing up on the front page) is dubbed "DANTE'S DECREE" is built around the idea of fire and gold. It have grey, and white keycaps, with crimson artisans keycaps. It also have a gold accent on the knob. I really liked the color scheme, because it's overall my favourite color. My actual profession is actually a computer science college student, and part-time video editor for a crime documentary channel. Btw, yes. The keyboard is real.
